# discord-container-ui-port

This package is a TypeScript port of the **discord.py Container UI** (1:1 API surface) for usage with `discord.js` v14.
It's intended to reproduce the Python API (Container, Item, TextDisplay, Section, Separator, MediaGallery, File) so that existing logic can be ported easily.

> This port focuses on API parity. It implements the same classes & methods as the Python version you provided, but is not a byte-for-byte behavior clone of every discord.py internal.
